Cardiac Rehabilitation — Challenges, Advances, and the Road Ahead

Each year in the United States, more than 1 million persons enter the turbulent waters of recovery after a cardiovascular event, such as myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG), heart-valve surgery, or heart transplantation.1 Surprisingly, only approximately 25% of patients who have had a cardiovascular event participate in cardiac rehabilitation,2,3 despite its multiple proven benefits.4

Cardiac rehabilitation, which is also referred to as cardiovascular rehabilitation, is a multidisciplinary, systematic, yet personalized approach to providing evidence-based secondary prevention therapies for persons with cardiovascular disease. The roots of cardiac rehabilitation go back to innovative investigators who pushed past the status quo of their time and established a new paradigm for patients with cardiovascular disease. Further innovation is needed today to increase the reach of cardiac rehabilitation to all eligible patients with cardiovascular disease and to bridge the participation gap in cardiac rehabilitation programs, one of the largest gaps in the quality of care in cardiovascular medicine today.2,5 This review addresses the current science and practice of cardiac rehabilitation, as well as the lessons learned from the past that will guide future directions in cardiac rehabilitation.

History of Cardiac Rehabilitation
Mater artium necessitas. (Necessity is the mother of invention.)

— William Horman, 15196
Cardiac rehabilitation began in the mid-20th century in response to the need for effective rehabilitative care to address the high morbidity and mortality associated with myocardial infarction and recovery from it.7 This development mirrored the earlier birth of physical therapy to meet the needs of patients affected by the poliomyelitis epidemic and soldiers wounded during World Wars I and II.8 Patients recovering from myocardial infarction in the 1950s often had limited therapeutic options and were restricted from engaging in physical activity for 6 weeks or longer.9,10

As early as 1772, Heberden noted a possible role for exercise as a therapy for cardiovascular disease, reporting that a patient with angina who sawed wood 30 minutes daily for 6 months “was nearly cured.”11 Until the 1950s, however, physical activity was generally prohibited after myocardial infarction because of concerns about ventricular rupture and hypoxemia during myocardial healing.12,13 In 1952, Levine and Lown reported that armchair exercise was both safe and beneficial for hospitalized patients recovering from myocardial infarction,14 and Wenger subsequently introduced a progressive physical activity regimen initiated in the intensive care setting.15 Hellerstein and Ford extended cardiac rehabilitation to the outpatient setting,16,17 a move that drew serious criticism because of safety concerns.18 The safety of outpatient cardiac rehabilitation was reported by Kennedy and colleagues in a small but important study showing that an outpatient exercise training program for patients with stable angina improved oxygen consumption for a repetitive workload,19 a finding that mirrored Heberden’s observation some 200 years earlier.11 In 1978, Haskell reported that in a study of 30 outpatient cardiac rehabilitation centers, severe cardiovascular complications were rare — about one fatal event per 100,000 patient-hours of cardiac rehabilitation exercise.20

As evidence emerged about secondary prevention for cardiovascular disease, cardiac rehabilitation centers evolved into centers of secondary prevention, providing nutrition therapy, psychological support, and management of risk factors for cardiovascular disease, in addition to exercise therapy.21 When a chapter on cardiac rehabilitation first appeared in the second edition of Braunwald’s textbook on heart disease in 1983, cardiac rehabilitation symbolically took an early step into mainstream cardiovascular medicine.22 Important evidence of the benefits of cardiac rehabilitation has continued to emerge, including a meta-analysis by Oldridge et al. of 10 randomized, controlled trials that included 4347 patients and showed a 25% reduction in cardiovascular mortality among patients randomly assigned to cardiac rehabilitation.23 Around this same time, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) began to provide coverage for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation services,24 and guidelines were published in 1995.25

Cardiac Rehabilitation Programs

The science and practice of cardiac rehabilitation have continued to grow over the past three decades. The current aim of cardiac rehabilitation is to help patients achieve the best possible cardiovascular health. Clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) recommend cardiac rehabilitation with supervised exercise training for patients with stable angina26 or stable heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction27 and for patients after myocardial infarction,29,30 coronary-artery revascularization by means of either PCI or CABG,31 or heart transplantation.32 In addition, supervised exercise training is recommended for patients with symptomatic peripheral-artery disease28 (Table 1). Worldwide, cardiac rehabilitation is also strongly recommended for these patient populations, particularly after myocardial infarction or revascularization procedures.33,34,36

Eligible patients enter the cardiac rehabilitation pathway when referred after a qualifying event or diagnosis, ideally beginning within 1 to 2 weeks after the event (Figure 1). Prompt enrollment in cardiac rehabilitation appears to improve patient participation in the program; participation is 1% lower for every 1-day delay in enrollment.37 Early enrollment also improves outcomes, with a 67% greater improvement in exercise capacity among patients enrolled in a program within 15 days after hospital discharge than among patients enrolled 30 or more days after discharge.38-40

On enrollment, patients undergo an evaluation that typically includes their history of cardiovascular disease, guideline-directed medical therapies, and coexisting conditions, as well as an assessment of their cardiovascular risk factors, exercise habits and capacity, dietary habits, body composition, psychological health, and quality of life. These evaluations are carried out by a trained, multidisciplinary cardiac rehabilitation team that generally consists of physicians, nurses, exercise physiologists, dietitians, social workers, and psychologists. This team designs an individualized treatment plan for each patient that is based on applicable evidence-based treatment strategies, as well as the patient’s needs, goals, and preferences. The plan is reviewed and signed by a supervising physician and updated at least every 30 days to help patients advance in their rehabilitation efforts.41,42

The goals of cardiac rehabilitation (Table 2) are personalized, with the intent to help patients achieve cardiovascular health and guideline-directed targets for control of blood pressure, lipids, weight, blood glucose, and tobacco exposure; adhere to guideline-directed medical therapies; and reach targets for control of coexisting conditions, including psychological disorders, musculoskeletal limitations, and sleep apnea. Unstable conditions, such as unstable angina or severe hypertension, are stabilized by the health care team before patients start cardiac rehabilitation. At the beginning of each rehabilitation session, patients are assessed for signs or symptoms of unstable disease, and vital signs are monitored before, during, and after exercise.

Patients attend 36 cardiac rehabilitation sessions, each lasting 1 hour, over a period of 12 weeks, during which they participate in exercise training, nutrition counseling, and educational and psychological support sessions according to their individualized treatment plan and under the guidance of their cardiac rehabilitation team. The framework for a treatment plan and an example are shown in Figure 2 and in Figure S1 in the Supplementary Appendix (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).42 Each patient’s treatment plan includes personalized, guideline-directed exercise comprising cardiovascular, resistance, flexibility, and balance training. Patients recovering from cardiac surgery are guided through physical activities that are appropriate for protecting the healing sternum from injury.43 Patients also receive nutritional counseling that focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, beans, other protein sources with low saturated fat content such as fish, and calorie restriction as needed for weight control. The treatment plan includes strategies for psychological support, management of coexisting conditions, and assistance in adhering to guideline-directed medical therapy aimed at reducing risk factors for cardiovascular disease.42,43 Electrocardiographic monitoring during cardiac rehabilitation is often used for patients with high-risk arrhythmias or other high-risk conditions but does not improve safety outcomes.44

At the completion of 12 weeks of cardiac rehabilitation, patients undergo a graduation assessment that focuses on progress made toward meeting their goals for exercise, nutrition, psychosocial factors, and other core factors, such as control of cardiovascular risk factors and adherence to guideline-directed medical therapies. The treatment plan is then updated to help patients continue to advance toward their rehabilitation goals after discharge from the program. A longer-term follow-up plan is also developed, to be carried out with the assistance of the patient’s cardiologist or primary care provider.

The traditional cardiac rehabilitation program is based in a hospital outpatient area or an outpatient clinic. Home-based cardiac rehabilitation, delivered outside the traditional cardiac rehabilitation center, has been studied since the 1990s but was rarely used in the United States until the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, when center-based cardiac rehabilitation programs out of necessity considered home-based cardiac rehabilitation options, which were temporarily covered by CMS during the public health emergency.45 With the end of the Covid-19 public health emergency, the future of coverage for home-based cardiac rehabilitation is unclear.

Recent Challenges and Advances in Cardiac Rehabilitation
Despite the myriad changes and challenges in cardiovascular medicine today, advances in cardiac rehabilitation have helped it grow in relevance and recognition. These advances are reflected by the growth in scientific publications in the field over the past 20 years.46 Studies have focused on several issues, some of which are highlighted below.

BENEFIT OF CARDIAC REHABILITATION TODAY
Given the risk factors and lifestyle habits of many patients with cardiovascular disease,47,48 cardiac rehabilitation continues to be beneficial by systematically helping patients apply evidence-based secondary cardiovascular disease prevention therapies. Benefits from cardiac rehabilitation include improvements in functional capacity,49 psychological health,50 adherence to treatment,51 control of risk factors for cardiovascular disease,52 return to work,53 and health-related quality of life,4 with reductions in hospital readmission rates4 and cardiovascular death rates.4

Although reductions in mortality have been reported previously in randomized trials,23,54 a systematic review suggests little or no effect of cardiac rehabilitation on all-cause mortality.4 This finding may be due to improvements over time in the usual care of patients or to quality issues in the trials themselves.55 All-cause mortality benefits are clear in large observational studies56 and show a dose–response association, with a 1 to 2% reduction in mortality for each cardiac rehabilitation session attended.57,58 Although this relationship may be due, in part, to healthy participant bias, the cardiac rehabilitation session dose–response is consistent with the dose–response effects of individual components of a cardiac rehabilitation program, such as exercise training and statin therapy.59,60 On the basis of a systematic review of randomized cardiac rehabilitation studies, the number needed to treat to prevent one myocardial infarction at 12 months is 75 and the number needed to prevent one hospital readmission is 12.4 Observational data suggest that the number needed to treat to prevent one death is 34 at 1 year and 22 at 5 years after PCI.61 The safety of contemporary cardiac rehabilitation was reaffirmed with the finding that one cardiac arrest was reported for every 1.3 million patient-hours of cardiac rehabilitation exercise.44

Cost–benefit studies are generally favorable with respect to cardiac rehabilitation.4 One study reported a savings of $2,920 (Canadian dollars) per year in medical expenditures for persons with cardiovascular disease who completed a program of cardiac rehabilitation, as compared with those who were not referred to cardiac rehabilitation.62 A systematic review showed that cardiac rehabilitation is cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ranging from $1,065 to $71,755 per quality-adjusted life-year gained and the most recent studies showing the most favorable results.63

BRIDGING THE PARTICIPATION GAP IN CARDIAC REHABILITATION
Despite the known benefits of cardiac rehabilitation, its impact on the cardiovascular health of the general population has been limited by low participation. However, this may be changing in the current era. A 2020 report indicated that participation in cardiac rehabilitation programs has increased in subgroups of patients, primarily those undergoing coronary-artery revascularization with CABG or PCI.2 Among patients undergoing CABG, participation increased from 31% in 1997 to 55% in 2020. For patients who had a myocardial infarction and were treated with PCI, participation in cardiac rehabilitation increased from 21 to 33%. Participation among patients in these groups, although improved, is still low. Unfortunately, participation dropped among patients with a myocardial infarction who did not undergo revascularization, from 11% in 1997 to 7% in 2020. Overall, only 24% of eligible patients participated in cardiac rehabilitation in 2020, one of the more striking and persistent gaps in cardiovascular care today.5 Furthermore, only 24% of eligible patients who began cardiac rehabilitation did so within 21 days after the qualifying event, and only 27% completed a full course of cardiac rehabilitation.2

The participation gap affects all eligible patients, but disparities are most pronounced for women, older patients, racial or ethnic minority groups,64 patients in lower socioeconomic groups, and those living in areas with limited numbers of cardiac rehabilitation programs.2,65 Only 18.9% of women, 9.8% of patients older than 85 years of age, 13.6% of non-Hispanic Black patients, 13.2% of Hispanic patients, and 6.9% of dual Medicare- and Medicaid-eligible patients participate in cardiac rehabilitation.2 Although 39% of eligible patients participate in cardiac rehabilitation in the West North Central Census Division, only 20% participate in other regions of the country, including the East South Central, West South Central, Middle Atlantic, and Pacific Census Divisions.65 These patient groups face substantial barriers to cardiac rehabilitation referral and participation, barriers that appear to be eliminated with systematic referral strategies66 and more tailored participation options.64,67

Our understanding of barriers to participation in cardiac rehabilitation programs has grown over the years, as has the discovery of effective solutions with varying degrees of anticipated effect and difficulty in implementation (Figure 3).67 The percentage of patients who participate in cardiac rehabilitation can be increased with the use of automatic referral systems and patient navigators.68 These interventions have been shown to boost patient participation in cardiac rehabilitation from 30 to 74%.66,68 However, implementation is challenging for many centers.71 In addition, the capacity of existing cardiac rehabilitation programs in the United States is well below what is needed; estimated capacity is sufficient to accommodate only 37% of eligible patients.72

Financial and insurance constraints are potentially correctable barriers to cardiac rehabilitation. Patients with no cost-sharing, such as copayments or deductibles, for their cardiac rehabilitation sessions attend, on average, 6 more sessions than those with any cost-sharing — a difference that would theoretically translate into a reduction in mortality of 6 to 12%, assuming a reduction in mortality of 1 to 2% per session attended73 and a reduction in hospital readmission rates and associated costs of approximately the same amount.4 Incentives — both financial69 and nonfinancial68 — also appear to improve participation in cardiac rehabilitation programs. One study showed that moderate financial incentives resulted in a doubling of the program-completion rate among patients covered by Medicaid.69

Other strategies that have been implemented to improve participation in cardiac rehabilitation are clinical practice guidelines (Table 1) and performance measures,3,7,74 including measures from the National Committee for Quality Assurance Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set that address cardiac rehabilitation initiation, attendance, and completion.75 In collaboration with the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation (AACVPR), the Million Hearts Cardiac Rehabilitation Collaborative, a multidisciplinary group with members from academia, government agencies, clinical care, and industry, has produced both a road map of strategies and a Cardiac Rehabilitation Change Package to help increase participation in cardiac rehabilitation to at least 70% nationally.70,76

Certification programs that promote patient participation and high-quality cardiac rehabilitation have also been implemented. Examples include the Joint Commission’s Comprehensive Cardiac Center Certification, which includes cardiac rehabilitation as one of its key components,77 the AACVPR cardiac rehabilitation program and professional certifications, the European Association of Preventive Cardiology clinician certification in preventive cardiology, and the Cardiovascular Rehabilitation Foundations Certification program of the International Council of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation, which shares resources with cardiac rehabilitation programs around the world.78 Although the effect of these quality-improvement efforts is not yet known, evidence suggests that groups that adopt quality-improvement strategies can significantly increase participation in cardiac rehabilitation.68,79,80

HOME-BASED CARDIAC REHABILITATION
Since DeBusk and colleagues showed the positive benefits of home-based cardiac rehabilitation in 1994,81 home-based programs have been seen as a promising solution to bridge the gap in the delivery of cardiac rehabilitation, especially for underserved groups. Home-based cardiac rehabilitation uses the same clinical components and trained personnel as center-based cardiac rehabilitation, differing only in the location where the program occurs. Patients communicate with cardiac rehabilitation staff members through telephone, video, or other messaging options either when they are exercising (synchronous communication) or at a time when they are not exercising (asynchronous communication). So-called hybrid programs use a combination of center-based and home-based cardiac rehabilitation.82

In 2019, an AACVPR–ACC–AHA scientific statement summarizing evidence on home-based cardiac rehabilitation with either synchronous or asynchronous communication reported short-term benefits that were similar to those with center-based cardiac rehabilitation.83 The statement concluded that home-based cardiac rehabilitation would be a reasonable alternative for persons who could not participate in center-based cardiac rehabilitation, with the caveat that longer-term outcomes and additional data are needed for women, racial and ethnic minority groups, and older persons.

Adherence to home-based cardiac rehabilitation appears to be higher than adherence to center-based cardiac rehabilitation, probably because of the greater convenience of a home-based program.84 A recent observational study comparing home-based cardiac rehabilitation with center-based programs, which involved a diverse population in southern California, showed similar rates of attainment of secondary prevention targets and lower 12-month hospital readmission rates among groups of patients who participated in home-based programs.85 A Veterans Administration observational study comparing participation in a home-based program with no participation in cardiac rehabilitation showed that mortality was 36% lower among patients who chose home-based cardiac rehabilitation than among those who chose not to participate in cardiac rehabilitation.86 Initiation of cardiac rehabilitation also appears to be higher for home-based cardiac rehabilitation than for center-based programs (43% vs. 13%).87 The cost effectiveness of home-based cardiac rehabilitation is favorable, but how it compares with the cost effectiveness of center-based cardiac rehabilitation is unclear.88

Several factors will determine whether home-based cardiac rehabilitation will help reduce the participation gap. These include evolving standards and regulations for home-based cardiac rehabilitation; evolving standards for the development, testing, and implementation of technological tools that may help improve the speed at which effective strategies for home-based cardiac rehabilitation can be used89; financially viable reimbursement strategies; and an alignment of cardiac rehabilitation delivery models with reimbursement strategies and regulatory groups so that home-based and center-based cardiac rehabilitation are seen as interchangeable.

Future Directions
“Necessity remains the mother of invention.”

— Clayton M. Christensen, 200390
The future of cardiac rehabilitation for eligible patients will include an array of tools and strategies to help deliver effective cardiac rehabilitation to increasingly diverse patient groups in various locations — from centers to homes to anywhere else they are throughout the day (at work, traveling, etc.). Advances in cardiac rehabilitation will also result from new intervention strategies and interactive tools, including wearable technologies, physiological monitors, and communication devices. These advances will help expand the effective options for interacting with and guiding patients in the short and longer term, with the use of a menu of evidence-based options tailored to each patient’s characteristics, needs, and preferences.89 Eligibility for cardiac rehabilitation will be expanded to address the needs of other patient groups, including patients with coexisting cardiovascular disease and cancer, patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction, patients with atrial fibrillation, and those with congenital heart disease. Cardiac rehabilitation will progressively be delivered before, not only after, a procedure is performed in a patient with cardiovascular disease (i.e., “prehabilitation”). Certainly, the highest priority for future improvement of cardiac rehabilitation will be to deliver longer-term, high-quality cardiac rehabilitation services to all eligible patients. New models, strategies, and tools will be essential as cardiac rehabilitation professionals and policymakers seek to move from a state of status quo — cardiac rehabilitation with high value but low utilization — to a state of “new and improved” — cardiac rehabilitation with high value and high utilization.

Conclusions
Cardiac rehabilitation began through innovative efforts to help patients recover after a cardiovascular event. Despite its known benefits, currently only a minority of patients participate in cardiac rehabilitation. Clinicians, administrators, and policymakers share responsibility for implementing effective steps to engage patients, support high-quality cardiac rehabilitation, and open pathways that lead all eligible patients toward the best possible cardiovascular health.
